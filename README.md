## Git Basics

As a beginner in the world of programming, I can say that it was a challenging but rewarding journey. At first, I struggled to understand the fundamentals of the Git, but after two days of focused effort, I finally grasped its essence. The following days were spent honing my skills by writing various commands.

1. My initial exposure to programming was a novel experience. I was particularly intrigued by the use of the Terminal on my Macbook, as I had only used it before to resolve issues when downloading programs. I was pleasantly surprised to discover VSC, which proved to be a much more efficient way of communicating.

2. My admiration for Git knows no bounds. The well-designed and meticulously executed features of Git are nothing short of amazing. Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, Git provides an intuitive and streamlined experience that truly stands out in the world of programming.

3. Of course, I plan to put my newfound knowledge to use in future lessons. I believe that through consistent application and repetition, I will be able to fully internalize and understand the concepts I have learned.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1. This was my first encounter with the Linux command line, despite having used a Macbook for over six years. In the past, I had limited exposure to the terminal and had limited understanding of its functionality. However, I was excited to finally have the opportunity to manipulate my file system through the terminal. The article about the HTTP protocol was initially difficult to comprehend, as I had limited understanding of how a browser operates. Nevertheless, after multiple readings and extensive research, I was able to form a basic understanding of the subject. I am aware that there is still much to learn and I plan to revisit this topic in the future.

2. I was impressed by the information about the data transfer protocol and the coherence and thoroughness of these systems. I was also intrigued by the <code>chmode</code> command, which I initially saw as a magical solution for launching torrent programs. I was surprised to learn that it was simply a change of rights.

3. I am already actively using various Linux commands, such as <code>cd</code>, <code>chmode</code>, <code>ls-l</code>, among others. Although I am still discovering the full potential of the terminal, I am moving in the right direction. As for the HTTP article, I have yet to fully understand its concepts and processes, as they are still abstract in my mind. However, I am confident that with time and continued learning, I will gradually fill in these gaps and apply my knowledge in a practical manner.

1. Upon completion of my studies on Git, I feel that I have a strong understanding of the topic. I am now able to visualize the Git commands and their meanings in a clear manner.

2. During the course, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of several Git commands that I initially had limited understanding of. I now have a clear understanding of the difference between `fetch` and `pull`, the concept of <code>upstream</code>, and the functions of <code>rebase</code> and <code>cherry-pick</code>, among others.

3. I plan to actively utilize the commands learned in this lesson as I tackle more complex tasks, beyond just editing README.md. (* ^ ω ^)

1. As a newcomer to the basics of HTML and CSS, I encountered many novel concepts while completing this task. From different types of tags, to creating forms, semantic tags, and basic styling, to the layout of elements on a website, everything was a new and exciting experience. I still have much to learn about CSS, and plan to continue my education through freecodecamp certification.

2. I was struck by the simplicity and depth of the concepts used for basic website markup and styling. The breadth of what can be achieved with these tools is truly impressive.

3. In preparation for a future task to create a pop-up, I focused on learning specific tools and techniques that would be useful. I approached the task like putting together a puzzle, first learning how to create a <code>nav</code>, stylize it, round edges, and arrange <code>li</code> elements in a row. Then I learned how to create a scroll menu using <code>overflow</code> and how to make it disappear. While a bit intimidating, I am committed to successfully completing this task.

## Responsive Web Design

1. My progress in learning CSS and responsive design has been substantial. I not only completed the task assigned to me on responsive design, but I also covered a range of other CSS topics. I created four responsive websites, and gained a solid understanding of the steps involved in analyzing and rendering layouts. Of particular interest was learning about flex and grid, which I discovered are extremely versatile tools for creating any layout. While there were some difficulties, such as figuring out how to proportion elements and interactions perfectly, I was able to overcome these challenges with a lot of hard work and determination. In total, it took me about a month and a half to complete the responsive design section and learn the basics of CSS.

2. The ease with which animations and transformations can be created was a pleasant surprise. Before I started learning about these topics, I thought that the tricks I saw on websites, like changing the position of an element when hovering, were only possible for the most talented web developers. I soon learned that animations are actually quite manageable, even when taking into account the fact that one property can contain timing, acceleration, and delay.

3. **Flex** has become a crucial tool in my CSS toolkit. I find myself using it more often than grid, although I expect this may change as I continue to develop my skills. I am already experimenting with various interesting transformations, and feel that I am beginning to gain expertise in this area. On the other hand, I still need to learn how to use variables other than colors, and how to write more concise media requests. While I've made a lot of progress, my code still has room for improvement, but I'm determined to continue learning and working. I've studied FreeCodeCamp courses, paid CSS courses through Codecademy, and I have a long list of other courses that I plan to tackle in the future. My ultimate goal is to master **JavaScript**, but I know that this will require a lot of work and dedication.

## HTML CSS Popup

[Demo](https://yazdrahobycha.github.io/HTML-CSS-Popup/) | [Code Base](https://github.com/yazdrahobycha/HTML-CSS-Popup) | [Pull Request](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-p2p/pull/215)  

The project was a challenging but exciting experience. At first, I thought manipulating checkboxes would be straightforward, but I soon realized that it was not as simple as it seemed. The biggest challenge I faced was arranging them with the focus state without breaking any pieces. I had to spend a considerable amount of time trying different approaches until I found a solution that worked.

Despite the difficulties, I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. The project turned out to be more visually appealing than I expected, and I am proud of my ability to create an elegant design. Who would have thought it - yours truly, with zero design skills, stumbled upon a magic spell that brought this project to life! It's like I stumbled into a parallel universe where design gurus reside and sprinkled some of their dust on me. I still can't believe it myself, but hey, I'll take it and run with it!

However, there is still room for improvement. The project needs to be fully adapted to fullscreen, which is one of my priorities. Overall, this was an excellent task that allowed me to learn a lot, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work on it. The satisfaction of completing a challenging project is truly priceless.
